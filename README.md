Hello everyone, this is the program I wrote, which includes reading and plotting data from MESSENGER, BEPICOLOMBO, and TIANWEN-1. 
 2025/4/8-------------------------------
 I have uploaded the code for downloading TIANWEN-1 MOMAG magnetic field data.
 The TIANWEN-1 MOMAG data requires login and COOKIES. My code first scrapes all the filenames and IDs, then automatically logs in using the username and password to download the corresponding files.
 These data are in PDS4 format, and I will later write the relevant code for reading and plotting the data.
